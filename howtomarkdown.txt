==================== FONT STYLE

	_italic_
//write in italic using an underscore

	**bold**
//write in bold using two asterisks

	**_this text is bold and italic_**
// the order of asterisks and underscores ususally does not matter.


==================== HEADERS

//There are six types of headers in markdown (decreasing in size)
	#Header one //use sparingly
	##Header two
	###Header three
	####Header four
	#####Header five
	######Header six //use sparingly


==================== LINKS

	[Click here.](www.clickhere.cokg)
//inline link

	This is my text. Click this [link][Website].
	Here my text ends.
	[Website]:www.website.cokg
//reference link
//reference to another place in the document
//reference link will not appeare in rendered text


==================== IMAGES

	![alt text](www.linktoimage.jpg)
//inline image link
//Alt text describes the image for the visually impaired.

	![alt text][image tag]

	[image tag]:www.linktoimage.png  //Define an image for the tag.
//reference image


==================== BLOCKQUOTES

	> This is a blockqoute.
//preface a line with the "greater than" caret to create a blockquote.

	>To extend the blockquote over multiple lines,
	>
	>one has to preface each line that shall be included into the quote
	with a "_greater than_" caret.


==================== LISTS

	* content 1
	* content 2
	* ...
//Create an unordered list by using single asterisks followed by a blank.

	1. content 1
	2. content 2
	3. ...
//Create an ordered list by prefacing each point with a number followed by a blank.

	* content 1
	 * subcontent 1
	 * subcontent 2
	* content 2
//Create nested lists (sub-bullets) by indenting one space more before the sub-bullet.
//You also can combine ordered and unordered lists!


==================== PARAGRAPHS

	This is the first paragraph.
	
	This is the second paragraph.
//hard break

	This is the first line.  
	This is the second line.  
//soft break
//Insert two spaces after each line!

==================== THE END (for now...)

There are many “extended” implementations of Markdown that support  
formats like tables, definition lists, footnotes, and more.
