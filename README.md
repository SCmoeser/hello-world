Just some space to start learning how to use GitHub from scratch.

Now I am editing this README.md file in order to test the _pull request_ feature, GitHub provides.

>_On GitHub, saved changes are called **commits**._ - [Hello-World-Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

>_Pull Requests_ show _diffs_ (=differences) of the content from both branches.
>Changes, additions and subtractions are shown in green and red. - [Hello-World-Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
