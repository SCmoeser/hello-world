# hello-world
Just some space to start learning how to use GitHub from scratch.

This is my first attempt on working with python and basically my first step into the tremendous new world of coding. Therefore I will gather many beginners tips that I consider usefull for myself and probably write some personal tutorials too.

So far this repository contains:
* README.md
* [howtomarkdown.txt](https://github.com/SCmoeser/hello-world/blob/main/howtomarkdown.txt) - a short introduction to writing in _Markdown_.
